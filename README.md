ðŸ“Œ Description: Java String Concept
In Java, a String is an object that represents a sequence of characters. Unlike many other languages where strings are just arrays of characters, Java treats strings as objects of the String class, which is part of the java.lang package.

Strings are immutable, meaning once a string is created, it cannot be changed. Any modification creates a new string object. Java provides rich support for string manipulation through methods in the String class and helper classes like StringBuilder and StringBuffer.

This project covers the basic to advanced usage of strings in Java, including declaration, concatenation, comparison, and common string methods.

ðŸ”‘ Key Points about Java Strings 

ðŸ“¦ String is a class in java.lang and is used to create and manipulate text.

ðŸ›‘ Immutable â€“ Once created, the contents of a string cannot be changed.

âž• Concatenation â€“ Use + or .concat() to join strings.

ðŸ§ª Comparison â€“ Use .equals() for content comparison, == for reference comparison.

ðŸ§¹ Common Methods:

.length() â€“ Returns the number of characters.

.charAt(index) â€“ Gets the character at a specific index.

.substring() â€“ Extracts part of a string.

.toLowerCase() / .toUpperCase() â€“ Converts case.

.trim() â€“ Removes leading and trailing whitespace.

.replace() â€“ Replaces characters or substrings.

.contains() â€“ Checks for substring presence.

.split() â€“ Splits the string based on a regex or delimiter.

ðŸ§± Mutable Alternatives â€“ Use StringBuilder or StringBuffer for efficient string modifications.
